MyFavoriteMovies is an app that uses The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org) to search and track your favorite movies.
This was a Udacity iOS Nanodegree app challenge. This app was partially completed by Udacity.
You will need to supply an API key and have a The Movie DB username and password in order for the app to work.
